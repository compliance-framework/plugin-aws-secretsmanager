# AWS Secrets Manager CCF Plugin

This repository builds a CCF RunnerV2 plugin for AWS Secrets Manager. It collects read-only Secrets Manager metadata, resource policies, version stages, tags, and CloudTrail event history, then evaluates configured Rego policy bundles against one normalized record per secret ARN.

The plugin never calls `GetSecretValue`.

## Subject

The plugin registers one subject template:

| Name | Type | Identity labels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aws-secretsmanager-secret` | component | `account_id`, `region`, `resource_id` |

Every evidence record also includes labels: `provider=aws`, `type=secretsmanager`, `subject=aws-secretsmanager-secret`, `account_id`, `region`, `resource_id`, `resource_arn`, `resource_type=secret`, and `account_tag_<key>` for account config tags. `resource_id` is the ARN segment after the final `:` and keeps the AWS 6-character suffix.

## Configuration

The CCF agent passes flat string config. Structured values are JSON strings.

| Key | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accounts` | `[]` | JSON array of `{account_id, regions[], role_arn, external_id, session_name, tags{}}`. Empty uses the ambient AWS credential chain. |
| `default_regions` | `[]` | JSON array used when an account omits `regions`; then falls back to the SDK default region. |
| `lookback_days` | `90` | Positive integer up to `90`, used for CloudTrail event history. |
| `policy_inputs` | `{}` | JSON object exposed to Rego as `input.policy_inputs`. |
| `policy_input` | `{}` | Alias for `policy_inputs`. |
| `policy_labels` | `{}` | JSON string map merged into evidence labels. |
| `max_concurrency` | `4` | Positive worker count for account/region targets; `0` is normalized to `1`. |
| `api_timeout_seconds` | `120` | Positive per-target budget covering all paginated Secrets Manager, CloudTrail, and STS calls for one account/region. |

Runtime logs default to `info`. Set `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` to override the level.

## Rego Input

Each secret is marshaled with `resource.type = "secret"`:

When AWS omits `KmsKeyId` for the AWS-managed default key, `config.kms_key_id` is emitted as the sentinel string `aws/secretsmanager`. Date fields are always strings and are `""` when absent. When no resource policy exists, `resource_policy` is `{"hash":"","document":null,"principals":[]}` and `resource_policy_present` is `false`.

`recovery_window_days` defaults to `0` and is populated from a matched CloudTrail `DeleteSecret` event's `requestParameters.recoveryWindowInDays` when that event is available. Secrets Manager does not expose the original recovery-window setting directly on `DescribeSecret`.

## Coverage

CONFIG evidence supports rotation, vendor credential, confidentiality, and privacy policy bundles through `DescribeSecret`, `GetResourcePolicy`, `ListSecretVersionIds`, and tags from `DescribeSecret`. Fields include rotation state, rotation rules, KMS key ID string, owning service, replication status, version stages, resource policy principals, and hashed name/description.

DYNAMIC evidence uses a 90-day default CloudTrail lookback. Secrets Manager events are filtered to `RotateSecret`, `PutSecretValue`, `UpdateSecret`, `UpdateSecretVersionStage`, `DeleteSecret`, `RestoreSecret`, `PutResourcePolicy`, `DeleteResourcePolicy`, `TagResource`, `UntagResource`, `CreateSecret`, and `GetSecretValue`. IAM credential-removal events are filtered to `DeleteUser`, `DeleteAccessKey`, `DetachUserPolicy`, `RemoveUserFromGroup`, `DeleteRole`, `DetachRolePolicy`, and `RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile`.

## CloudTrail Attribution

Secrets Manager events are matched to a secret by ARN, friendly name with suffix, or friendly name without suffix using substring checks against the raw CloudTrail event during collection. This is intentional because many Secrets Manager event types put the identifier in `requestParameters` rather than the structured `Resources` list.

IAM credential-removal events are account-wide. The plugin parses affected `userName`, `roleName`, `userArn`, and `roleArn` from `requestParameters` and attaches the event only to secrets whose resource-policy principal strings substring-match those identifiers. Unmatched IAM events are dropped.

Only normalized event fields are emitted; raw CloudTrail payloads are not included in Rego input.

## Error Scoping

Target-level failures, such as `ListSecrets` or CloudTrail lookup failure for an account/region, are stored once under target scope. They are not copied onto every secret.

Per-secret failures, such as a `GetResourcePolicy` error for one ARN, are attached only to that secret's `collection.errors`. `ResourceNotFoundException` and empty resource policies are valid no-policy states, not errors.

## Out of Scope

KMS key policy, key rotation, and grants are collected by `plugin-aws-kms`; this plugin records only the `kms_key_id` string from Secrets Manager. IAM principal resolution belongs to `plugin-aws-iam`; this plugin records policy principal strings and CloudTrail IAM-event ARNs only. Decrypted secret material is never read.
